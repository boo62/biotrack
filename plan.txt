1) Obtain new and old versions of UniProt database.

There is a service for this called UniSave RESTful Web-Services. You
can give an accession and a version number and it fectches that
version, e.g.,

http://www.ebi.ac.uk/uniprot/unisave/rest/raw/P94465/79

will fetch accession P94465 (ribR B. Subtilis) version 79. It can also
get all versions or just a certain range. Not sure how to get just a
versions and the most recent if you don't know the most recent
number. Perhaps from the main website.

ribR (B. Subtilis, P94465) has 97 entry versions
sonic hedgehod (homo sapians, Q15465) has 189 entry versions

The website also does a nice comparison with the information that I
need so I should see if biopython or something else has this.

To link to a particular version of an entry, use the version parameter
in the link, e.g. to link to version 109 of P00750 use:
http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P00750.txt?version=109 

2) Work out how to obtain a field (or detect if it exists) for a given species.
3) Is there an inbuilt way to detect whether a field has changed/been updated?
4) Work out how to compare two fields
5) Extract some test cases from them
) Write some unittests


Choose example species
E. Coli - likely to have been in the database from the start but may
not have had as many updates.
B. Subtilis - As above and have some familiarity with it.
I know of the recent ribR function update.
S. Cerevisae - As above but with larger genome
Homo Sapian - Has many proteins and likely to have had many updates.


Things we know/specify
- Organism
- gene name
- ideally an accession

Things to track:
Function - e.g. unknown for ribT in subtiwiki
http://subtiwiki.uni-goettingen.de/bank/index.php?gene=ribT

Expression and Regulation
SubtiWiki has a good section on this. e.g. for ribR
http://subtiwiki.uni-goettingen.de/bank/index.php?gene=ribR&action=Go
SubtiWiki also has a references section which could also be tracked
with the assumption that no new information will be added without a
new reference.

UniPathway - doesn't seem to be species specific

Gives pathway components e.g., riboflavin biosynthesis in B. subtilis,
identifier UPA00275:
http://www.unipathway.org//upa?upid=UPA00275&oscode=BACSU

In uniprot search pathway 399.275 with further species constriants
gives a list of proteins in the pathway:
pathway:399.275 bacillus subtilis (strain 168) AND reviewed:yes
