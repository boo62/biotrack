# It is slow to obtain entry data from a url every time when running
# tests. I only need to do this when I change a method which affects
# model insantiation. I can pickle some test cases and load these in
# order to test new methods which do not affect the instantiation. If
# I change the instantiation I will need to repickle the test cases.
#
# How to test the instantiation?
#
# Instantiations should be tested in a separate test file which is run
# separately from other unittests and will be much slower. I will have
# to work out how to exclude these from py.test.
#
# Alternatively instantiation could be tested after the fact using the
# results it produces in the pickled test cases.
