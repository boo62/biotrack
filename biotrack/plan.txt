Things we know/specify
- Organism
- gene name
- ideally an accession

Things to track:
Function - e.g. unknown for ribT in subtiwiki
http://subtiwiki.uni-goettingen.de/bank/index.php?gene=ribT

Expression and Regulation
SubtiWiki has a good section on this. e.g. for ribR
http://subtiwiki.uni-goettingen.de/bank/index.php?gene=ribR&action=Go
SubtiWiki also has a references section which could also be tracked
with the assumption that no new information will be added without a
new reference.

Rate constant
Availible for some enzymes in UniProt
